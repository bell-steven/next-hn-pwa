I built this to demonstrate the potential speed of a javascript web application.

Built using 'create-next-app' with SW-Precache for service workers.

Next.js isn't playing nicely with Preact in development, and in production the TTFB is slower for some reason, so I will hold off on that for now. ðŸ¤·

This is very much a WIP. ShowHN and AskHN are still not live.
